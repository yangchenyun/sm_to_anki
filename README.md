## How it works

### The original directory is
    memo_course
      - course.xml
      - itemxxxxx.xml
      - media
        -- xxxxx.jpg

`course.xml` which stores the course category and hierarchy.
`itemxxxxx.xml` stores the item question and answer. In Supermemo UX it contains four types:
  * Simple Question and Answer
  * True or False
  * Multiple choices
  * Pick the right choice
  * Cloze
`media` file contains the media files refered by

### The output skeleton is

    {course_title}_anki/
      - sub_category1
        - simple_qa.txt
        - cloze.txt
        - multi_choice.txt
        - truth.txt
      - sub_category2
    {course_title}.media/
    {course_title}_processed_item.txt

The hierachy between course items are preserved with file system hierarchy
Items are stored according to their types and are within the category they belong to

### Media Files Processing
Files within original media folder are prepended with a namespace
`xxxxxa.jpg` will be converted to `course_title_xxxxx1.jpg`
*course_title* is transformed from the `<title>` field of the `course.xml` file and is converted to underscore.

### Item Processing
The information of the item is processed as html string.
The first field of every item should be `{course_title}_id` to make this entry unique across anki
Processed items will be stored within the `processed_item.txt` separate with `,`
